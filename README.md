# MoonBit QuickCheck

QuickCheck is a library for random testing of program properties. The programmer provides a **specification / theorem** of the program, in the form of properties which functions should satisfy, and QuickCheck then tests that the properties hold in a large number of randomly generated cases.

## Features

MoonBit QuickCheck brings many modern academic ideas into industrial practice.

### Testing Strategy

- Test randomly
- Test all finite values up to some depth

### Data Generation

- Functional Enumeration 
- Random Generation

### Property Verifcation

- Existential Quantification
- Algebraic Invariant
- Boolean Property
